Announcer/Advertiser add-on for LibsHungergames. Send messages on the boss bar

Add a Boss bar to advertise/broadcast messages from the config.yml. Stop advertising when the game starts.

This plugin:

    Broadcast an motd, if chosen in the config.yml.
    Broadcast an unlimited amount of messages.
    Support colors
    Doesn't work without libhungergames

The boss bar messaging will only send messages/advertisements until the game has reched a certain event and will stop just after this event is reached . Then the the boss bar will disappear for all players.

This is meant to advertise players i.e. just before the fight start for real, leaving players with full attention while fighting.

configure accordingly in config.yml

Player joining the game after invincibility wear of (spectators) will not see the boss bar advertisements, we let them spectating in peace! If you chose so in config.yml

This plugin require: Lib's Hungergames, protolLib.

Tested and build around: spigot #1487, LibsHungergames 5.4.9 & 5.5, ProtocolLib 3.4.0 snapshot.

Works with 1.7 to 1.8
